# x402 Farcaster Mini App - Project Documentation

## Background and Motivation

**NEW PROJECT REQUEST**: Build a **DeFi Long-Term Capital Gains Analyzer**

### Project Requirements:
- **Core Function**: Enter wallet address → analyze DeFi positions held for >1 year
- **Tax Optimization**: Help users identify positions eligible for long-term capital gains treatment
- **User Experience**: Avoid manual transaction checking for every position

## Key Challenges and Analysis

### Core Technical Challenges

1. **Multi-Chain DeFi Data Aggregation**:
   - Need to query multiple blockchain networks (Ethereum, Base, Arbitrum, Polygon, etc.)
   - Parse complex DeFi protocol interactions (liquidity positions, lending, staking)
   - Handle different token standards (ERC-20, ERC-721, ERC-1155)
   - Track position entry/exit events across protocols

2. **Real-Time vs Historical Data**:
   - Balance current positions vs. historical transaction analysis
   - Need accurate timestamps for 1-year calculation
   - Handle chain reorganizations and failed transactions
   - Cache expensive queries to manage API costs

3. **DeFi Protocol Complexity**:
   - Each protocol has unique contract structures
   - Position representation varies (LP tokens, receipt tokens, NFTs)
   - Need to understand wrapped/derivative assets
   - Handle protocol upgrades and migrations

4. **Tax Calculation Logic**:
   - Determine position entry date (first interaction vs. last increase)
   - Handle partial withdrawals and reinvestments
   - Account for rewards/fees affecting cost basis
   - Different rules for different position types

### Data Source Requirements

1. **Blockchain Data**:
   - RPC endpoints for multiple chains (Infura, Alchemy, QuickNode)
   - Historical transaction data and logs
   - Current state queries for active positions
   - Gas cost tracking for accurate calculations

2. **DeFi Protocol APIs**:
   - Uniswap V2/V3 subgraphs for LP positions
   - Aave/Compound for lending positions
   - Curve for stable pools
   - Yearn for vault positions
   - Protocol-specific position tracking

3. **Price Data**:
   - Historical token prices for cost basis calculation
   - Current prices for P&L analysis
   - DEX price feeds vs. centralized sources
   - Handle low-liquidity/exotic tokens

### Technical Architecture Decisions

1. **Backend Strategy**:
   - Node.js with TypeScript (consistent with current stack)
   - Redis for caching expensive queries
   - Queue system for long-running analysis jobs
   - Rate limiting to manage API costs

2. **Blockchain Integration**:
   - Viem for type-safe contract interactions
   - Wagmi for wallet connections (if needed)
   - Multiple RPC providers with fallback logic
   - Efficient batch querying strategies

3. **x402 Monetization**:
   - $1 per address scan (100x current $0.01 protected route)
   - Consider tiered pricing for multiple addresses
   - Free preview with limited data
   - Premium features for detailed analysis

### Business Model Analysis

1. **Revenue Potential**:
   - Target market: DeFi users with significant positions (high-value customers)
   - Pain point: Manual tax calculation is time-consuming and error-prone
   - Value proposition: Save hours of work + reduce tax mistakes
   - Market validation: Existing tools like Koinly charge $50-300/year

2. **Cost Structure**:
   - RPC API calls: ~$0.10-0.50 per comprehensive address analysis
   - Infrastructure: Redis, hosting, domain (~$50/month initially)
   - Break-even: ~2-10 scans per month to cover API costs
   - Scaling: Caching reduces marginal costs significantly

3. **Competitive Advantages**:
   - **Speed**: Focused on long-term positions only (not full tax reports)
   - **Price**: One-time $1 vs. annual subscriptions
   - **Simplicity**: Single address scan vs. complex onboarding
   - **x402 Integration**: Seamless crypto payments, no sign-up required

4. **Growth Strategy**:
   - Phase 1: Ethereum DeFi power users
   - Phase 2: Multi-chain expansion
   - Phase 3: Additional features (bulk pricing, watchlists)
   - Phase 4: API for other tax tools to integrate
